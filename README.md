# Hybrid Recommendation System ML Project

## 📝 Project Overview
Today, I built a **Hybrid Recommendation System** using **Python**. This project integrates **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** to provide personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** for recommendation accuracy.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed to understand data trends and clean datasets.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied techniques to enhance model performance by creating new features.  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based methods to improve recommendation quality.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Main language used for the project development.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools for EDA.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.  
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning model for advanced recommendations.  

## 🔍 Features & Analysis:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.  
- **Data Normalization**: Scaled the data for better algorithm performance.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like **RMSE** and **Precision** to evaluate the model.  

## 💻 How to Run:
1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/abhishekkumar62000/Hybrid-Recommendation-System-ML-Project.git`.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Run the project:  
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py  
   ```

## 📈 Future Enhancements:
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Implement a system for real-time data updates.  
- **Better Hybrid Models**: Test other hybrid recommendation techniques for more accuracy.
